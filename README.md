Research Team at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM)
Advancing Applications of Topological Data Analysis (TDA)

A team of researchers at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) has come together with the mission to expand the applications of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) across diverse fields. Led by a group of experts from the School of Mathematical Sciences, the team focuses on advancing the use of topological approaches in understanding complex data structures and uncovering insights that traditional methods may overlook.

Their research explores the frontiers of applied topology, incorporating innovative techniques such as persistent homology, Mapper algorithms, and other cutting-edge TDA methods. By fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, the team aims to address real-world challenges in areas ranging from data science and machine learning to public health, biology, and beyond.

With a dedication to pushing the boundaries of mathematical research, this team at USM is poised to make significant contributions to both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of topology-driven data analysis.
